WorldsColumbianExposition
=========================

A web app created as a supplemental resource to a museum exposition about the 1893 World's Fair.

Features my app will/can include are:
Image gallery with explanations of the image content 
I will probably choose 3-5 different parts to focus images on from the following topics:
  new inventions
     - Pabst Blue Ribbon
     -Juicy Fruit
      spray painting
      ferris wheel
      architecture of fair
      biographies of people involved in planning
      art included in art building
      midway plaisance
      first ferris wheel features
      scope of different important buildings
        art building
        children's building
        state buildings
        Horticulture Building
        Administration Building
        Women's Building
        Electricity Building
  Quiz about facts from the WCE with a possible additional feature
      upon completion of quiz an incorporation of the twitter API will allow people to tweet about the app 
  Map with clickable landmarks & pop out of explanations 
  Fire that destroyed the fair
  Possible inclusion:
      souvenir "giftshop" of memorabilia - an additional web/image gallery that lets users view the type of souvenirs available at the time 
      ability to write on a souvenir postcard and email it to someone

An example of the type of project I am interested in pursuing can be seen in the work that the MET has done to add interactivity to add interactivity to their exhibits.
